      "answer": " ok, share any specific challenges you faced while working on certification and how you overcome them  ah, ok, actually for the challenges, there are some challenges when i took the certification  especially for the project i mentioned that i already working with it  the first one is actually to meet the specific accuracy or violation laws for the evaluation matrix  and actually that just need to take some trial and error with different architecture  for example like  we can  try to add more layer, more neurons, changes the neurons  or even i also apply the drop out layer  so it really helps with the validation laws to become more lower  and i think that's one of the biggest challenges that i have while  working on this certification",

Di...  Di...  Tidak di akhir  Di...  Di tengah layer  Jadi, ada layer flatten  Bukan flatten, layer convolutional  Dan layer flatten  Dan saya menggunakan layer dropout  Yang saya gunakan dengan rate 0.2 atau 0.5 jika saya tidak salah  Dan layer dense dan layer output terakhir  Ini adalah efeknya...  Ini sangat membantu untuk...  Kebaikan akurasi kita dan turunkan keterangan validation kita  Dengan membalaskan beberapa layer sebelumnya  Ya, misalnya kita memiliki layer dense 64  Dan layer berikutnya, kita mengimplementasikan layer dropout dengan rate 0.5  akan berubah secara random setiap epoch dari layer dance yang sebelumnya",
